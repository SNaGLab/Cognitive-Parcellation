Data used in this project is from Imagenet Challenge

1. Navigate to http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/nonpub-downloads and download the validation images "Validation images (all tasks). 6.3GB. MD5: 29b22e2961454d5413ddabcf34fc5622". Save the file and extract it into data directory
	- The folder should contain 50 images from 1000 classes of data (in total = 50000 images)
	- You can find the list of 1000 synsets here http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/browse-synsets
2. Also Download the Development kit from http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/.  
	- Extract the file 
	- copy ILSVRC2014_devkit/data/ILSVRC2014_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt to data/
	- copy ILSVRC2014_devkit/data/meta_clsloc.mat to data/
3. Download alexnet_weights.h5 from http://files.heuritech.com/weights/alexnet_weights.h5 and copy it to data/weights/ folder
4. meta_clsloc.mat contains a list of all the different synsets and the corresponding description of the synsets
	- Randomly a few different synsets (from the first 1000 entries) and make a note of its corresponding ILSVRC2014_ID
		- For example: I picked four different synsets that can be grouped together into animate class
			- 3 - Siberian Husky
			- 6 - gret whaale, devilfish ...
			- 389 - bald eagle, american eagle ...
			- 653 - snail
		- Similarily  I picked four different synsets that can be grouped together into inanimate class
			- 300 - bookcase	
			- 512 - electric fan
			- 664 - toaster
			- 934 - Fountain pen
4. Enter the IDs and the corresponding class name in prepare_data.py in the /code directory
	- this will create individual folders under /data directory and populate them for the class name 
		- In our case it is data/animate/ and data/inanimate
